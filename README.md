# ModelMerging
This research explores the effect of combining multiple machine learning models to increase the efficiency in time and memory in contrast to running them in parallel

## Running Different Models 
* Change the model import in the __init__.py to the model you want to run
* Change the saving name in main.py
* Run main.py
